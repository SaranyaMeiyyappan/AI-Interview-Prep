# LLM Model

## Large Language Models

### General Concept
These are advanced AI systems built on deep neural networks designed to process, understand, and generate human-like text.

By using massive datasets and billions of parameters, LLMs have transformed the way humans interact with technology. They learn patterns, grammar, and context from text and can answer questions, write content, translate languages, and much more.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI systems trained on very large amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.
> From a backend perspective, an LLM works as a text-in, text-out service. It predicts the most probable next tokens based on context, which allows it to answer questions, summarize text, explain errors, or generate structured responses.
> As application developers, we typically consume LLMs via APIs, rather than building or training them ourselves.
> 
> **Examples of popular LLM providers include:**
> - ChatGPT by OpenAI
> - Gemini by Google
> - Claude by Anthropic
> 
> “These models are typically accessed through REST APIs or SDKs.”
>
> **“So does the model actually understand meaning?”**
> 
> “LLMs don’t truly understand meaning like humans. They generate responses based on learned language patterns and probabilities, which is why validation and guardrails are important in backend systems.”
